### Things to Check for:
1. Do the links to all of the author tags work?
2. Is everything that can be an arrow function an arrow function?
3. Is the body triple ‘stached?
4. Check that both filters are working- they will need to add the data-author attribute to their template and make sure it’s value is in quotes to avoid bugs where author has first and last name
5. Check that ‘publishStatus’ is displaying properly


### Things to Check On All Labs:
1. Any console errors?
2. Check all comments
